Cunnamulla Fella
Now I'm a scrubber, runner and a breaker too
I live on damper and wallaby stew
I've got a big cattle dog with a staghound cross
I never saw the scrubber we couldn't toss
'Cause I'm the fella from Cunnamulla
Yes I'm the Cunnamulla fella

Now once when I was drovin' on the cattle trails
I met a little girl her name was Ada Vale
I said "Marry me Ada and I'll be the fella
And we'll settle down in Augathella"
I'll be the fella at Augathella
Yes I'll be the Augathella fella

Oh, she said her daddy's name was Charley Ville
She had a lot of kiddies and a lot of bills
So I grabbed my horse that was nice and handy

And I never stopped till I reached Dirranbandi
I was the dandy at Dirranbandi
Yes I was the Dirranbandi Dandy

Now in my moleskin trousers and my Williams boots
Aboard an outlaw as he leaves the chutes
In my goose neck spurs I rake their fiery hide
And the girls all shouting around the ringside
Oh he's the fella from Cunnamulla
Yeah he's the Cunnamulla fella

Now I've done a little fightin' in the western bars
Done a little lovin' neath the moon and stars
I wear bright clothes and shirts full of colour
And the girls know me as that certain fella
Yes he's the fella from Cunnamulla
Yes he's the Cunnamulla fella

Oh he's the Cunnamulla fella
Yes he's the Cunnamulla fella
