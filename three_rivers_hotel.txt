Three Rivers Hotel
We curse at the things that go wrong through the day
And vow that we'll snatch it, go far away
But when day is done and we're soon feeling well
And laughter rings out from Three Rivers Hotel

There's Wesley the barman and young Irish Joe
Serving the booze and collecting the dough
What a stir they would cause if they ever should tell
All the secrets they've learned in Three Rivers Hotel

On the night after payday there's fun and romance
It's a night for the fam'lies to sing and to dance
You can let down your hair and come out of your shell
And do your own thing in Three Rivers Hotel

And if you listen to the bosses when the night's gettin' late
On the progress they're makin' the best in the state
They'd be finished this line and this maint'nance as well
If they worked like they bragged in Three Rivers Hotel

And if you think you can drink we've got money to back
On stayers like Cass and old grader Jack
And they tell me old Coster gives everyone hell
When he gets on the booze in three Rivers Hotel

[Spoken:]
Yeah, he's a whopper

When this job is finished we'll pack up and go
To another construction still chasing big dough
But wherever I wander my memory will dwell
On those happy days in Three Rivers Hotel
